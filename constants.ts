[Happy Birthday mi cielo🫂🫂💜..
Do you that you are the only one who plays major role in my life.Without you I would have lost the most beautiful days in my life.I never thought that I would fall in love that too you because in this world no one will exists like you...its like one and only piece...thank you for coming.Without you it would not happen because it's you who took all the efforts .In this imperfect world I got the perfect girl it's you.So many members used to say that don't love, it ruins your peace,she will control you,the most happydays in your life will be gone,but it's not true in everyone's story .It depends on the person whom you choose.But for me
•Without you, I wouldn't be confident on myself

•Without you, I wouldn't recognise my capabilities
•Without you,I would be a depressed person
•Without you,I wouldn't have any proper goal
•Without you,I wouldn't have controlled my anger
•Without you,I wouldn't have tried to control my overthinking 
•Without you,I wouldn't have known the value of a message 
•Without you,I wouldn't have known the value of call
•Without you,I wouldn't have known the value of notifications 
•Without you, I wouldn't have known the value of Good morning and Good night
•Without you,I wouldn't have known how real smile would be
•Without you,I wouldn't have known how real happiness would be
•Without you,I wouldn't have known the value of tears
•Without you , I wouldn't have known the value of a mistake 
•Without you,I wouldn't have known the value of one night 
•Without you,I wouldn't have known the value of 5 mins 
•Without you, I wouldn't have known the value of a journey 
•Without you , I wouldn't have known the happiness in changing for you
•Without you, I wouldn't have known how real peace would be
•Without you, I wouldn't have know how careing would be

[May be it may take a lifetime for me to show how your love changed me.When ever we had fights I used to think about it once again and I try to change myself to not to repeat it again and be like the one you want.I was feeling happy for changing myself that too for you sometimes it may take more time to show the change in me .But I never gave up on changing myself.From the first day onwards I used list out the things you don't like if they are in me I used change them.I am not this type of person but it's you who changed me.I think may be this is love.

You are the one and only best thing that ever happened in my life.In inter and LT I used to how unlucky I was but all that luck came at once and made us too meet.Sometimes I used feel am I deserved for the love you had on me,it may take a lifetime for me to show the same love.Be the way your are don't change it even if I told.I am sure that this year will be far better than last year,I will make that.I will be there for you in every situation.Thanks for coming into my life...Once again
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISS SUNDARAPALLI LAKSHMI SAMHITHA 🥳]`;
